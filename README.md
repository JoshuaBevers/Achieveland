-- clean up console logs
-- loading button while data is being collected from database.
-- removing glitch where ui hits mongodb with two requests with only one is required.

### Long Term

-- Add achievement difficulty
-- Add achievement/ game contributor -- potential monitezation point down the line.
-- UI improvements from Ant.design
-- ant designs progress bar for complete game achievement. https://ant.design/components/progress/
-- Material snackbar for a more responsive UI feedback on the claim button so the page doesn't have to reload. https://material-ui.com/components/snackbars/
user controller will have the modified to send a response that the UI listens to.
