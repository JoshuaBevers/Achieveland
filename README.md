# version 1.0.0.1

## Goals

### Short Term

-- Create incoming and outgoing data verification
-- import a package for yaml to JSON conversion
-- create a short script to scan JSON database and verify data integrity. This can be done locally to save compute time.
-- form data rather than requiring people to e-mail me their achievement ideas.

### Long Term

-- Make the game-stub page slightly more mobile friendly. Condense info or force page to only display one achievement per line.
